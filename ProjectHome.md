# NOTE: #
# Code moved to https://github.com/timingattestation #

This site will store the proof of concept implementation for Checkmate, a timing-based attestation system.

It also now hosts the self-checking code only for the derived implementation, "BIOS Chronomancy". Note that because this system was integrated with a real commercial Dell E6400 BIOS, we cannot post a full working system, and the provided code is meant only to show the self-checking algorithm used for the paper's results.

The source code is currently available from the Downloads or Source tab.

The installation videos are available on the InstallationConfigurationVideos wiki page.

If you would like to read the paper describing Checkmate, it is available here:

The whitepaper for BIOS Chronomancy will be available soon.
